# Urban Lunch Company

## Business Prompt

The Urban Lunch Company runs lunch service each weekday
 from multiple store-front locations in cities across the United States.

The company employs
 executives, regional managers, order preparers, and payment station attendants
 to operate lunch service at each location.
 Company executives organize each location into a single geographic region
 and delegate operational responsibilities
  of all regional locations
  to a regional manager.
 Most regions have multiple locations,
  but some regions at some times only have one location.
  The same employee may manage multiple regions at the same time.

A few times per year,
 the manager of each region
  is responsible for designing a seasonal menu to feature salads and healthy lunch options
  made from locally-sourced and organic ingredients.
  All regional locations serve the same lunch menu for a specified period of time, until the new seasonal menu replaces the old one.
  A region need not change seasons at the same time as another region,
   and need not change seasons at the same time each year.

Each menu contains a list of food options. The options are organized into visual display categories like "Salads", "Grains", "Soups", "Beverages", and "Custom".
 Each non-custom menu option is represented on the menu with a name, brief description, caloric content, gluten-free categorization, and vegan-friendly categorization.
 For custom orders, the menu specifies the list of available ingredients and indicates the maximum number of ingredients from each ingredient family that may be added without causing a price overage.

The menu does not include prices for individual items or ingredients, however the company does specify an internal base price for each menu item and ingredient. The company is not required to charge for the same menu item the same base price across regions or seasons. Sometimes the company adjusts regional item prices mid-season. Executives use a separate system to track ingredient procurement and usage information.





Before serving a menu for the first time,
 the company is required by its board of directors
  to publish the caloric and allergen content
    of each individual menu option and ingredient. The company is not required to publish menu pricing information.

During lunch service at any location,
 customers have the option to order in-person
 or online. Customers who order in person communicate their order to a food preparer.  Customers who order online first must fill out a profile,
   which includes their name and dietary preferences/restrictions.
   Each customer may associate one or more credit cards with their profile. Online orders, upon payment authorization, trigger a printer in the kitchen of the order pickup location to print the order details, which are then read by a food preparer.

The food preparer prepares the order according to the customer's instructions.

Each customer must pay for his/her order before picking it up from the payment attendant.

Customers may present payment in cash, credit card, gift card, loyalty rewards card, or mobile application QR code.
 A customer may pay for an order using only one method.
 If one payment method is denied, the customer has an opportunity to present an alternate method.

If the customer presents enough cash,
 the payment attendant authorizes the transaction.

If the customer presents a gift card,
   the payment attendant scans the card, and the system checks the balance.
   If the balance is sufficient, the system authorizes the transaction and updates the gift card balance, else the system denies the transaction.
   Regardless of the outcome, after making the payment transaction authorization decision, the system indicates the current gift card balance.

If the customer presents a credit card,
 the payment station attendant scans the card and waits from a transaction authorization decision from an external authority.

If the customer presents a mobile phone,
 the payment attendant scans the customer's QR code, and the system checks to see if the code matches an existing customer profile. The system authorizes the transaction if there is a match, else it rejects the transaction. A customer needs to create an online profile and associate at least one credit card before the system will recognize that customer's QR code.

If the customer presents a loyalty rewards card,
 the payment station only authorizes the transaction if the card has 13 loyalty stamps.
 The company has decided to stop issuing loyalty rewards cards in favor of online customer profiles, but the company still honors legacy rewards cards. Each time a customer pays for an order, the payment station attendant stamps the card once.
