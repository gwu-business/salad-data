### Menu Update Process

When a menu is created or updated,
 an employee manually removes the large chalkboard from the wall,
 transcribes menu information onto the chalkboard,
 and hangs it back up on the wall.
 Sometimes the employee stands on a stool or ladder to obviate need to lift the chalkboard.
