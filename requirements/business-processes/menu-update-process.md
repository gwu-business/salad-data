### Menu Update Process

After the regional manager creates a new menu and executives sign-off on the menu, the company prints thousands of paper copies to be distributed to customers in each location, as well as two sets of wall-sized menu boards (one primary and one back-up) to be hung in each location.

After printing, the company arranges for a rental van to transport the menu boards to each location, and pays employees overtime to receive and install the new menu.
