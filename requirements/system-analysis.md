# Salad System Analysis

## System Objectives

 1. Display a digital menu with accuracy
 * Automate the menu update process
 * Process payments
 * Capture and store a comprehensive history of orders and payments
 * Support executives in decision-making

## System Justification

 Although the Salad System implementation will cost thousands of dollars
  in upfront and ongoing software and hardware costs,
  it will save the company money in the long run
   by avoiding hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnecessary legal fees
   and thousands of dollars in payroll costs.


## System Information Requirements

### Information Inputs

#### Menu Metadata

 The company currently describes each menu item and ingredient,
 and categorizes each in terms of its calorie count, gluten composition, and vegan-friendliness. The system needs this menu item metadata to properly display the menu.

#### Order Details

To store a comprehensive transaction history,
 the system needs to capture data about each order and payment.

#### Customer Payment Information

To process customer payments, in some cases the system requires customer credit card information.

### Information Outputs:

  1. Menu Report (for publishing)
  * Digital Menu (for storefronts)
  * Order and Payment Transaction History Report (for mobile app users)
  * Order Summary Charts (for regional managers)
